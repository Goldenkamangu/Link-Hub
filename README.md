# Link Hub

A modern, responsive, and feature-rich personal start page to organize and display a curated collection of web links.

## Features

-   **Modern Card Layout:** Links are displayed in a clean, responsive grid of cards.
-   **Light & Dark Mode:** Toggle between a light and dark theme with a single click. Your preference is automatically saved in your browser.
-   **Live Search:** Instantly find links by typing in the search bar. The list filters in real-time based on the link's title and description.
-   **Category Filtering:** Organize links by category and filter the view to show only "Development," "Learning," "Tools," or all links.
-   **Interactive UI:** Smooth hover effects on cards and a subtle slide-in animation for cards as they enter the viewport.
-   **Fully Responsive:** The layout adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the web page.
-   **CSS3:** For all styling, including the responsive layout, theming, and animations.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactive functionality, including theme switching, search, filtering, and animations.
